    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NLP tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.\n",
    "    - Example: Monitoring social media for public opinion on brands or products.\n",
    "- Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another.\n",
    "    - Example: Google Translate facilitating communication between speakers of different languages\n",
    "- Text Summarization: Producing a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document.\n",
    "    - Example: Summarizing lengthy documents or articles for quick information retrieval in news aggregators.\n",
    "- Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into written text.\n",
    "    - Example: Voice-activated assistants like Appleâ€™s Siri or Google Assistant.\n",
    "- Text classification: Assigning predefined categories to text documents.\n",
    "    - Example: Classifying emails as \"spam\" or \"not spam.\"\n",
    "- Question Answering: Building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in natural language.\n",
    "    - Example: ChatGPT, Geminy\n",
